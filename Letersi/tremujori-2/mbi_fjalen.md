 Word

The spoken word is the sensory manifestation of the human concious. In of itself, the word, is just a tool, a tool only as powerful as the user. The tool's functionality of doing good and bad is undeniable, but again, the tool can do nothing unless used. Unlike the brain, the concious is close to impossible to study, this makes the word, an extension of the mind, rather difficult to fully understand. Having said that, the word is part of very standardized system of communication called language. Languages are many and even though not similar looking or sounding, logically they are the same. 

Word is the cornerstone of logic, which is manifested through speech. The speech is as powerful as the word, which is as powerful the logic. Communication wise words are often ignored and taken for granted by the listener and the speaker, however this only shows how robust the human concious is. 


Languages have been under constant usage and have evolved past literate communication and now posses aesthetic nuances. These are as a result of the sufficiency of words, many words, same idea. Seeing this, would be only right to say that words now not only posses meaning, they also posses emotion.

Such tool that posses logical meaningfulness and emotional impact, is a tool worthy of fear.
