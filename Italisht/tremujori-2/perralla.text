Once upon a time there was a seahorse ugly like a shoe and tiny like a needle. One day he decided to take his fate in his own hands and started his journy to the magician of the underwater. The journy was difficult, but with a spirit like a lion and muscles like a seahorse, our seahorse arrived at the magician's castle. In order to enter, he had to knock on the door, on the 20 meters tall and 5 wide door. This task seemed difficult, but not imposibile for this tiny body and huge spirit seahorse. He cafefully calculated a plan. When everything was ready he started exctuing hiw marvelous plan. He ran 1 kilometer away and ran back to the door, hoping that crashing on the door would make a large enough noise. Not only the noise wasnt looud enought, but that crash resulted on seahors's death, he was squashed to death with noone knowing.
